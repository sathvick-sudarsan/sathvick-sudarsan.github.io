							<p>Hi, I'm Sathvick, an inquisitive, hardworking, and open-minded data scientist currently pursuing my Master's at Rutgers University. With a solid foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in various data science roles, I've developed a deep passion for machine learning and sports analytics. My work at Globus Labs and NUS has honed my ability to tackle complex problems head-on. As I often say, "If someone asks me a question and I don't know the answer, I'll be the first to admit it, but I guarantee I'll figure it out and do whatever it takes to solve it."</p>
							<p>Outside of data, you will find me usually gaming, watching or playing soccer, improving my rating(ELO) in chess or creating new video content. I believe that curiosity, continuous learning, and a relentless pursuit of excellence are the keys to success. Letâ€™s connect and explore how data can drive meaningful change.</p>
